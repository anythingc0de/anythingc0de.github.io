Hello World! My name is Sushant Kathuria (Sush), and I'm a senior software developer with a passion for coding and trying out new technologies. When I'm not busy coding, you can find me traveling to new destinations, playing with my adorable pet, binge-watching my favorite web series, or reading the latest tech news.

Speaking of tech, I have a strong background in various programming languages like PHP, Python, SQL, and NoSQL. I also have experience working with AWS and Linux, which has helped me to develop scalable and secure applications. I believe that learning is a never-ending process, and I'm always up for trying out new things, like tinkering with Raspberry Pi for fun.

In fact, I recently hosted a website on a Raspberry Pi using DDNS, which was a challenging yet exciting project. I love how technology allows me to experiment and explore new possibilities.

Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences and knowledge with other like-minded individuals who are passionate about technology and its endless possibilities. Stay tuned for more exciting content, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in web development, scripting, or automation.
